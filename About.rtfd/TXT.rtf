\f0\b\fs32 \cf0 Munki SelfService (On Demand) Utilities
\b0\fs24 \
v.1.0.0 \
March 6, 2016\
Alex Narvey / Precursor.ca\
\

\fs28 Here is a set of utilities that take advantage of Munki\'92s On Demand nopkg script delivery capability which can be run over and over since they do not actually \'93Install\'94.\
\
No warrantee is offered. Neither express nor implied. Use at your own risk.\

\
To use them:\
\
1) Copy the plist files from the pkgsinfo folder into:\

\f2 munki_repo/pkgsinfo
\f1 \
\
2) Copy the icons from the icon folder into:\

\f2 munki_repo/icons\

\f1 3) Run the make catalog command:\

\f2 usr/local/munki/makecatalog\
\

\f1 4) Add the Packages to the \'93Optional Install\'94 property of the desired Manifest.\
I used Munki Admin for this.\
\
5) Save the changes in Munki Admin and then update the client to see your new Utilities in a \'93SelfService\'94 category.\

\b \cf0 PS-dns_flush_cache
\b0 \
Flushes the DNS cache on 10.10.4 and higher. \
10.10.4 or higher\
It could work for 10.9.5 too but I did not build in the logic to discern the OS and provide the relevant alternative for 10.0.0 -> 10.0.3. (Maybe in version 2.0)\
\

\b PS-hello_world
\b0 \
A harmless test for proof of concept. It throes up a dismissible dialog box box.\
10.9.5 or higher\
\

\b PS-iOS_screen_share
\b0 \
It prompts the user to plug in their iOS device and then launches QuickTime and starts a Movie Recording to share the screen with a remote support session.\
It does not seem possible at this time to use command line to choose the iPhone/iPad camera - the user must do this manually. (I\'92ve tried over 20 formulations with no success so if anyone knows how please share!)\
10.10.5 or higher\
\

\b PS-launch_services
\b0 \
Resets launch services to help with problems in window display and open with performance.\
10.9.5 or higher.\
\

\b PS-mail_optimizer
\b0 \
Vacuums the Mail app database to make it more efficient.\
10.9.5 or higher.\
\

\b PS-mail_rebuilder
\b0 \
Deletes the Mail app Envelope and causes Mail to resync with the server and pull down all the messages again. Can take a long time depending on amount of mail and internet speed.\
10.9.5 or higher.\
\

\b PS-spotlight_rebuilder
\b0 \
Deletes the Spotlight index (for both internal and external disks). Performance WILL be impacted during the rebuild.\
10.9.5 or higher.\
\

\b PS-user_font_cache
\b0 \
Deletes the active users font cache.\
10.9.5 or higher.\
